### What I learned

I learned a LOT of things her. The core knowledge i've taken from this challenge is how many ways there is to sanatize and validate forms, i tried to use vanilla react so i could try every validation's techniques, using objects, using useContext hook, using vanilla html, unsing forms, i tried all of them. It's not perfect but i'll rearrenge and study more in the future.

### Continued development

I'll try to make more adjusts, like drying the css code and more.
